## Getting Started
Just click the poster, what you need will pop up.

## Unsolved Problems
1. The item tiles cannot align correctly. Some items with longer title will cause the other items in the next row cannot be shown correctly.
2. I have no idea how to automatically set a .active class to make the according navigation bar tile color  red just like the home page. Setting it manually seems strange.
3. Most music video cannot play. It just says: "This video contains content from VEVO. It is restricted from playback on certain sites or applications."
