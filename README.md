## Getting Started
Just click the poster, what you need will pop up.

## Usage
1. run ```python entertainment_center.py```  
 * The movie, TV shows, music video and books item will be randomly sorted to generate the HTML file respectively.  
 * As for the homepage fresh_tomatoes.html, it is generated by randomly chose 3 items per category -- and sorted in the order -- movie, TV shows, music video and books.
2. The generated homepage fresh_tomatoes.html will be opened automatically in a browser new tab. Enjoy!
3. The displayed items can be changed by replacing the data in data directory.

## Unsolved Problems
1. The item tiles cannot align correctly. Some items with longer title will cause the other items in the next row cannot be shown correctly.
2. I have no idea how to automatically set a .active class to make the according navigation bar tile color  red just like the home page. Setting it manually seems strange.
3. Most music video cannot play. It just says: "This video contains content from VEVO. It is restricted from playback on certain sites or applications."
